# multibodysystem

Matlab script for animation of masses. Object oriented for easy adding of masses and connections.
Can be integrated with Simulink for simulation results.

TODO: Allow for creation of springs.

TODO: Allow for creation of dampers.

TODO: Make connections end at edges of masses.

TODO: When importing simulation data from Simulink, automise time scale to match desired fps of animation (right now adaptive step length cant be used).

TODO: Allow rotation and translation at the same time
